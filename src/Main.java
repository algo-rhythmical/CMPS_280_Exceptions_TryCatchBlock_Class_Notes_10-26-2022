/*Today's agenda:

-Exceptions:
    - represent specific types of errors/edge cases in your code.
    - They all inherit from the "Throwable" class.
    - most of the time, we will use a child class of throwable, called exception, as a parent class
    - whenever an exception happens, your program crashes.
    - 'throws': used in method/constructor declarations to tell Java that said method/constructor
        may or may NOT throw an exception.
    - 'throw': inside of a method/constructor, to actually use an exception.

-Try/catch block:
    - used to deal with exceptions that may happen.
    - syntax:

        try {
            //run the code that may or may not throw an exception
        }
        catch(Exception exceptionObject) {     //type your trying to catch
            //where you deal with the exception that was thrown
        }
